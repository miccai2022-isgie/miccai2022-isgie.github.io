# MICCAI 2022 - Imaging Systems for GI Endoscopy

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with almost two million new 
cases in 2020, worldwide. Early detection is of paramount importance on detecting cancer at an early stage, 
due to a 5-year survival rate close to 100% at stage I, and below 10%, at stage IV. Traditional colonoscopy 
remains the gold standard procedure because of its dual capability to optically inspect the colonic mucosa 
and to remove polyps, because they may eventually become cancer. In the last decades, new technologies have 
supported clinical decisions with AI and ML algorithm playing an important role in this process.

This workshop focuses on novel scientific contributions to vision systems, imaging algorithms as well as 
autonomous system for endorobot for GI endoscopy. This includes lesion and lumen detection, as well as 3D 
reconstruction of the GI tract and hand-eye coordination. Applications include but are not limited to 
wireless capsule endoscopy, standard optical colonoscopy, as well as endorobots for endoscopy. 
Contributions should demonstrate potential clinical benefits describing current stage, development 
path and challenges to overcome before translation into clinical practice.
