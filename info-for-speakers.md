The final workshop program is now available [here](https://miccai2022-isgie.github.io/program/#schedule). We will be
using [Pathable](https://pathable.com/) as our virtual platform. Access to Pathable will be already available to all
MICCAI registered participants. If you still do not have access to Pathable, kindly
use [this](https://miccai2022.pathable.eu/) link and try recover password or contact Pathable directly. Please note that
the presenter of your paper must [register](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/REGISTRATION.html) with MICCAI in
order to access Pathable. Only registered presenters will receive access information. Please
refer [here](https://miccai2022-isgie.github.io/program/#schedule) for your presenter's registration status and your
presentation mode. The Pathable virtual system uses the Zoom platform for the live meetings in webinar or meeting style.
Virtual participants are required to install [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) to join the workshop. If you are new to Pathable,
please watch [tutorial videos](https://miccai2022.pathable.eu/tutorial-videos) and
visit [FAQ](https://miccai2022.pathable.eu/faq).

Link to all material must be submitted no later than _September 11, 2022_. Our support team will be en route to
Singapore and will not be able to assist you after _September 13, 2022_. File upload instructions are sent to the
presenters by email via CMT.

MICCAI2022 will be a primarily in-person event with virtual components. The conference agenda will follow
**Singapore local time**. All presenters are expected to be available at the scheduled presentation time for live
presentations, regardless of the presentation mode (in-person or virtual).

**Oral Sessions**

For Oral sessions, presentations will be given live followed by a live Q&A. All sessions will be broadcast LIVE to
Pathable where the virtual conference attendees can participate in real-time.

**Instructions for Oral Presenters**

Please prepare slides for a 10-minute presentation. After your talk, there will be approximately 5 minutes for
questions. We asked all oral presenters (both in person or virtual) to submit weblink to both presentation slides and
backup video presentation prior to the workshop. Timing will be strictly enforced to ensure a smooth handover between
speakers. Please ensure that you have rehearsed the timing of your talk beforehand. As a rule of thumb, you should have
one slide per minute of talk time. The session chair will introduce each speaker and the title of the talk. For virtual
speakers, if your presentation has videos, make sure to tick "share sound" and "optimize for video clip" in the zoom
share window.

**Slides Format and Upload**

In-person presenters will be required to use the workshop system to minimize setup time. Instructions to submit weblink
to your slides is communicated to the presenter by email via CMT. There will be a speaker-ready room for presenters to
check their files with the conference system. You can download MICCAI 2022 presentation
template [here](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/files/downloads/MICCAI2022-Presentation-Template.pptx).

The preferred slide formats are Microsoft PowerPoint and Adobe PDF. Please prepare your slides in 16:9 aspect ratio. We
also suggest to bringing a copy of all the files including videos on a USB key for in-person presenters. If you are
including videos in your presentation, it is highly recommended you use a standard codec such as Microsoft Video 1 to
avoid playback issues. Exporting the presentation using the Package for CD option from PowerPoint will ensure that all
media files are copied into one location and file paths are adjusted inside the presentation. Windows Video Player is
installed in the presentation computer. Please rename your presentation file to "**slides_X.ppt**" or 
"**slides_X.pdf**", where X is your oral session ID as in [schedule](https://miccai2022-isgie.github.io/program/#schedule).

**Video Format for Pathable**

The weblink to 10 minutes backup video of your presentation must be submitted prior to the workshop. Format: mp4 at
1080p, maximum file size 2 GB, encoded with H.264 (AVCHD) video codec and AAC audio codec. For uploaded videos, please
keep the encoded video bitrate between 4.5Mbps and 6Mbps to balance quality and playback smoothness. Please rename your 
mp4 file to "**video_X.mp4**", where X is your oral session ID as in [schedule](https://miccai2022-isgie.github.io/program/#schedule).
