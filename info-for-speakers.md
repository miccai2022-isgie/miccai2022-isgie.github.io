The final workshop program is now available [here](https://miccai2022-isgie.github.io/program/#schedule). 
Access to [Pathable](https://pathable.com/) and upload instructions will be sent to 
the presenters soon. Please note that the presenter of your paper must register in order to access Pathable. 
Only registered presenters will receive access information. Please refer 
[here](https://miccai2022-isgie.github.io/program/#schedule) for your presenter's registration status and your 
presentation mode. 

Please be reminded that each oral presentation will also have an associated poster presentation. All material 
must be uploaded to Pathable no later than September X, 2022. Our support team will be en route to Singapore 
and will not be able to assist you after September X.

MICCAI2022 will be a primarily in-person event with virtual components. The conference agenda will follow 
**Singapore local time**. All presenters are expected to be available at the scheduled presentation 
time for live presentations, regardless of the presentation mode (in-person or virtual).

**Oral Sessions**

For Oral sessions, presentations will be given live followed by a live Q&A. We will be using Pathable as our 
virtual platform. All sessions will be broadcast LIVE to Pathable where the virtual conference attendees can 
participate in real-time. We will be communicating with virtual presenters in September with detailed instructions 
on how to access your assigned session.

**Instructions for Oral presenters**

Please prepare slides for a 10-minute presentation. After your talk, there will be approximately 5 minutes for 
questions. We asked all oral presenters (both in person or virtual) to upload a backup video presentation to 
Pathable one week prior to the conference. For in-person presenters, presentation slides must be 
submitted (or uploaded to conference computer systems) in advance to minimize transition time between presenters. 
Timing will be strictly enforced to ensure a smooth handover between speakers. Please ensure that you have 
rehearsed the timing of your talk beforehand. As a rule of thumb, you should have one slide per minute of talk time. 
The session chair will introduce each speaker and the title of the talk. Each oral presentation will also have an 
associated poster presentation. Upload details and access to Pathable will be communicated to you at a later date.

**Slides Format and upload** 

In-person presenters will be required to use the conference system to minimize setup time. Your slides must be 
submitted one day before your scheduled talk day. Instructions to submit your slides will be communicated to 
the presenter in September. There will be a speaker-ready room for presenters to check their files with the 
conference system.

The preferred formats are Microsoft PowerPoint and Adobe PDF. Please prepare your slides in 16:9 aspect ratio. 
We suggest bringing a copy of all the files including movies on a USB key. If you are including videos in your 
presentation, it is highly recommended you use a standard codec such as Microsoft Video 1 to avoid playback 
issues. Exporting the presentation using the Package for CD option from PowerPoint will ensure that all 
media files are copied into one location and file paths are adjusted inside the presentation. Windows Video Player 
is installed in the presentation computer.

**Video format for Pathable**

Your 10 minutes backup video of your presentation must be uploaded to Pathable one week prior to the conference. 
Format: mp4 at 1080p, maximum file size 2 GB, encoded with H.264 (AVCHD) video codec and AAC audio codec. For 
uploaded videos, please keep the encoded video bitrate between 4.5Mbps and 6Mbps to balance quality and 
playback smoothness.
